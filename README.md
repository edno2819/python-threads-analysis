# Python Threads Analysis

This repository demonstrates how Python handles threading, and why Python threads do not provide true parallelism due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). It also provides an example of how to achieve parallelism using Python's `multiprocessing` module and compares it with Goroutines in Go, which offer more efficient concurrency.

## Introduction

Python is a versatile programming language, but when it comes to multi-threading, it can be misleading. This repository explores how Python's threading works, the limitations caused by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), and how to achieve true parallelism using the `multiprocessing` module.

We also compare Python threads with Go's Goroutines, which are much more efficient for concurrent programming.

## Conclusion

Python's threading model, constrained by the GIL, does not support true parallelism, making it inefficient for CPU-bound tasks that need to run concurrently. For parallel processing in Python, use the `multiprocessing` module. If you require high-performance concurrency, languages like Go provide a much better alternative with features like Goroutines.
